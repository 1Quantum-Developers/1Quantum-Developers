  <h1>Reporting — Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

  <div class="qa">
    <details open>
      <summary>Who receives reports?</summary>
      <div>
        Reports are received by our operations and security team for triage. For security-specific reports, the maintainers listed in SECURITY.md are notified.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Can I file a report anonymously?</summary>
      <div>
        Yes. The reporting form accepts submissions without contact details, but providing an email helps us follow up for clarification. If you prefer secure or encrypted disclosure for sensitive security issues, consult SECURITY.md.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How long will it take to get a response?</summary>
      <div>
        Acknowledgement is typically within 1–3 business days. Critical security issues get prioritized and often receive a faster response.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What if I have large log files or captures?</summary>
      <div>
        The web form is not intended for very large attachments. Please provide a secure link (e.g., to an authenticated file share) or contact us directly as described in SECURITY.md for secure transfer.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will my report be made public?</summary>
      <div>
        Not without your consent. We will only make details public following our disclosure policy and with appropriate redaction. For security vulnerabilities, we follow coordinated disclosure practices where possible.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>What happens after I submit a report?</summary>
      <div>
        We triage the report, assign a severity, and create an internal ticket. We may request additional details. Once resolved, we may provide a summary of actions taken if appropriate.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Is there retaliation for reporting?</summary>
      <div>
        No. We have a strict non-retaliation policy. Reporting in good faith will never be punished.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>I found a security vulnerability — what should I do?</summary>
      <div>
        Please follow the disclosure guidance in SECURITY.md. If you want direct secure contact details, that file will list the preferred channels and PGP keys (if available).
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>How do you handle sensitive personal data?</summary>
      <div>
        We handle sensitive personal data only when necessary for triage and remediation, and we retain it only as long as needed following our privacy practices. If you have privacy concerns, indicate them in your submission.
      </div>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Who can I contact for help submitting a report?</summary>
      <div>
        If you have trouble using the form or need help formatting evidence, include a short note in the form or consult the contact methods in SECURITY.md or the repository README.
      </div>
    </details>
